## Description:

This project was created for CS3307 Fall 2020.    
PiWriting is able to take an image of a handwritten sentence or message and convert it to digital text form. The text can then be read aloud or saved as a separate file for further use. Our goal was to make this system as easy to use as possible so that it can be useful for those with visual impairments or disabilities that affect a person's ability to read or take notes.
